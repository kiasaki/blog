# Frederic's Blog & Personal Website

This blog used to be plain old html files...

Then it became a Jekyll blog...

Then it used a tiny tool called [muun](http://github.com/kiasaki/muun)...

Then it used [Hugo](http://gohugo.io)...

Then it used Ghost for a short amount of time...

Now it's using Hugo again & Netlify CMS.
