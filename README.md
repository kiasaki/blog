# My own little blog

This blog used to be plain old html files

Then it became a Jekyll blog for a good part of it's life but wanting some change
and no dependency on ruby to build it but still whishing for it to live on GitHub
pages...

Then it used a tiny tool called [muun](http://github.com/kiasaki/muun).
A simple static blog generator written in Go.

Now it uses [Hugo](http://gohugo.io).
