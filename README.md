# Frederic Gingras's Blog & Personal Website

This blog used to be plain old html files...

Then it became a Jekyll blog...

Then it used a tiny tool called [muun](http://github.com/kiasaki/muun)...

Then it used [Hugo](http://gohugo.io)...

Now it's using Ghost.

# In this repository

- `hugo-based`: The Hugo files that were last used to generate this site
- `kiasaki-theme`: The theme I am using for Ghost
- `deployment.yml`: The file I use to delpoy Ghost to Kubernetes
