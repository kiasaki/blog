    <h2>I do</h2>

    <p>I help small B2B SaaS products deliver value to their clients faster.</p>

    <p>
      Unlike most developers that worry about the code they write, the abstractions
      they use, the frameworks theyâ€™ve chosen, I recognise the importance of all of
      these without making them my sole purpose. <strong>I focus on the target customers,
      I work on figuring out if we are shipping the <i/>right</i> feature. I work on
      making sure that existing features and new features actually work and deliver
      value, not <i>headaches</i>.</strong>

    <h2>I am</h2>

    <p>A web developer who values less code, building software that ages well and thoughtfully designed code boundaries. I am not fanboy of any specific tool or language but more of the right tool for the job and being able to ship quickly.</p>

    <p>I am based in Toronto, Canada, come from Montreal and often work remotly for clients or employers.</p>
