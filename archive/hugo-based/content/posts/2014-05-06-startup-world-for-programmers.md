Have you ever found yourself wishing to start a company, not that your job is boring
or not paid enough, you just feel like working on a product that you really love, that
would fix a problem you see every day and goes without any solution. It might even
just be the risks, adventures and friendships comming with it.

Before you start anything I suggest you to read, read all you can, and think, take
special time to meditate. Not that this is a really difficult decision but,
it is important not to plunge yourself into something, spend all your free time (that
used to be family time) in building something you don't even know about.

Building a startup involves a lot more than just hacking away for two months and
comming up with a working prototype. After all this will have to pay enough so you
can afford a living so think twice, is it a viable idea, is there a market for it,
can I build it or does it require the help of someone extern, will I have to
hire someone from day 1 beacuse you miss some specific skill.

But now, let's say you have a rock solid idea, I'd suggest __stop__ and find a co-founder,
yes it may seem like a major turn off but, really small is the number of companies
started by one person, they at least had a really close mentor to help them during
the journey. Having a co-founder will not only prove that somebody else has the same
passion to solve the problem you are trying to solve but you will also have someone
being there to bring you back on the right path if ever you start thinking to big,
going off road or starting to add useless features.

Like __Phil Libin__ founder of _Evernote_ said at startup school 2013:

> Don't even make friends with people you wouldn't start a company with.
