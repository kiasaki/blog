This post is about the pomodoro technique, is short it's a method of time management that aims at helping you get more done by focusing on one things at the time. It goes as follows:

- Decide on a task to work on
- Remove distractions and work only on that for 25 minutes
- Take a 2-5 minutes break
- Work again
- After 4 "pomodori" as they call them take a longer 15-30 min break
- Repeat until said task is done

Now, there is a lot of good in this method and it is helpful for accomplishing all kinds of work, heck there are even Kickstarter projects selling you timers ans sand-glasses for this, but the point I want to make is, that it is **not necessarily that well suited for programmers**.

Let me explain myself, what pomodoro solves if getting to concentrate on one thing for 25 minutes blocks but this something I have no problem doing as a programmer, when I get **in the zone** I ignore being hungry, sleepy, needing to pee, and other distractions and can simply work hyper focused for few hours, that is, given an interesting project I _wish_ to work on (really important). Then, if I happened to take a break and browse a bit on-line, read an article or two, boom! focus totally broken, I venture for few minutes, which quickly become half and hour and then when I drag myself back to the task I started I just wish I knew what was hiding behind those 3 little hyper-links I say before switching back to the terminal.

Actually, I thing this observation comes down to: when not able to concentrate and when you have multiple small tasks of about 30 minutes / an hour to accomplish, OR, a big task that you don't really want to work on, **pomodoro** really helps. But, when you work on a super interesting project and you are fully motivated, taking breaks only hinder you, anyways you don't even want those breaks right?

Well that's my take on it!
