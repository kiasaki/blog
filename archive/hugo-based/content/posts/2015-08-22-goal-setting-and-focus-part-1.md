Constant goal setting and laser focus is something that, now I reflect on it, seems like an evident answer to how much I have advanced skills and career wise in the past two years, but, was mostly done naturally/by intuition up till now.

I read, about six months ago, a really good book called "The One Thing: The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Results" by Gary Keller and it talked almost entirely about those two items.

So, let's try and define those terms, plus, give you advice and example on how to implement them in you daily life and work.

## Goal Setting

Goal setting, here, takes on a wide definition and is not about have one and only goal but more to go through the process of constantly having goals.

**Goal Setting: Timeframe**

You should be setting goal not for in X years but for this day, this week, the next 90 days, the next year and the next 5 years. There are different sizes of goals and some can only fit in years from now, while others, are really need to be accomplished today so that you can move on with a project.

The goal you set for yourself to attain in 5 year will naturally involve smaller steps that will become your 1 year goals. In turn, your 1 year goal will involve 90 days goal and so on.

**Goal Setting: Frequence**

The thing with goal, especially the short term ones, is that they are in constant movement. Depending on what you accomplished yesterday you might have new thing planned for today, or, you are catching up as you got distracted and didn't get to finish what you set out to do yet.

__You will constantly be updating your goals.__ I personally try to take 10 minutes every morning to hash out what I _need_ to accomplish and take 1 hour or so every week to update my goals for next week plus all the longer term ones if needed.

**Goal Setting: Context**

Now you might be thinking of a there is a conflict here, we want to be setting only one goal per time-frame but what if we want multiple thing. Well, here's the solution/middleground you should keep having only one 5 year goal say, for your career, but, it's evident that you will have _a different set of goals_ for your family, other ones for your love life and other ones for your personal improvement. Have as much "set of goals" as _areas_ of your life you consciously work on daily.


_This was part one of a two part series, in the next post we will define further the focus part and explore how, coupled with goal setting, you guarantee yourself tremendous personal, career and relationship improvments._
