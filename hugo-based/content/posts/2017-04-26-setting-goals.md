At time, months can seem to go by so fast. And months turn into years quick. We
all dreamt of becoming X when younger. That X profession or occupation probably
morphed over time. It became something less exciting but much more "realistic".

A similar thing happens with dreams and aspirations. Most people have some
secret aspirations they daydream about from times to times. The problem is they
feel so big, so imposing, so far away, out of our reach.

Here's the thing, every person you look up to didn't get there by accepting
their current reality. They got there by setting their mind on a goal and
**acting on it**. All action towards a goal, even if it seems small, brings you
closer to accomplishing it. It makes every action coming after easier. The
compounding effect every one of those small steps is difficult to grasp but
works wonders over the course of many years.

So **start now**! Pick something you wish to do or become and write it down. Make
sure it's someplace you will see on the daily. Then, take the first step in the
general direction of achieving it. However small it may seem, it'll have a big
impact when compounded with all the other steps you'll take in the weeks,
months, and years to come.

That's it. Stop wishing  and start moving by being deliberate about your goals,
writing them down, and acting on them.
