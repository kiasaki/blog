This post is part an anouncement that I left full time employment and am looking for what's next 
and part tips on being a good entrepreneur. It has been quite the uphill battale, I have learned
a lot about clients, e-commerce, SEO, caring for UX and thinking about features you build,
managing projects and expectations. Apart from that, while working at Anekdotes and going to
school I worked on plenty of personnal projects and read a lot to improove my web developper
skills. I have always been passionate and amazed at how much the tech world has to offer in
terms of learning opportinities! I love it!

Today, I feel like there is more I could do, I read more and more about business, startups,
and lifestyle design and all that matches with the way I think and what I wish to do.
So what comes next is more learning oppotunities, meeting alot of new people and working on
projects I am passionate about for all kinds of entrepreneurs.

I once read a blog post from [Adii Pienaar](http://adii.me) that listed the 5 steps to becoming
a better entrepreneur:

## Starting is scary but necessary

The most difficult step you have to overcome is: **Actually kicking your own ass and Starting**.
Quitting my first real job and the people I have worked with and became friends with was not
an easy decision, but I had hints that thing was to way to go: projects were more and more
borring, promises were being broken about fun projects, development time and augmentations, plus,
I just finished college. So, from today, I will be focusing on:

- Going to more conferences and meetups in the _Montreal_ tech community
- Working on my skills in technologies I enjoy the most
- Developing my "personnal brand" i.e. my blog & github & twitter
- Either finding a job in the perfect company OR starting my own ventures
- Keeping a good balance between work, diet and physical activities

## Working with your strengths and passions

Yes, everybody has strengths and passions and those are what makes you unique and those are what
you are good at, so use them! Fully embody them! If you are still uncertain of what those are
in your case then start searching and keep this thought in the back of your head. Once you know
what are your forces, work with them, leverage them and knowing what are your weeknesses, work around
it, join forces with somebody who completes you.

## Need to build a personnal brand

Whatever venture you jump in or company you work at, keep in mind that what you have left after failing
or quiting your job is only yourself, yourself and how people percieve you.

## Tech startups is for anybody

Anybody can build a startup, whatever your current job title, learning and building your own prototype
is possible.

Nowadays there is more and more courses and websites that are simply GREAT for beginning programming,
there is even those new hip bootcamps that can train you and learn you web development or building mobile
apps in 12 weeks or so. I don't think those render you in a senior programmer but they surely allow
you to build a minimal product and help you test your ideas!

It's is simply awesome that the barrier to entry in tech is now so low that anybody can enter it or
at least comprehend it. So here are few site suggestions: [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/),
[Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/), [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/),
[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/cs), [Lynda](http://www.lynda.com/)

## Don't become a startup hipster

There is an balance to keep between work and life. Nowaday people in startups are working so hard they almost
kill anything that is not their startup: relationships, family, fun, travel, reading even their own body.
But, keeping good habits regarding sleep, diet and time spent with friends and family is crucial to your success.

Burnout is very real and overworking yourself will simply make you less and less productive. So get those 8 hours
of sleep and take care of yourself, life is plenty of fun things to enjoy that will only help you be more
creative during your workday.
