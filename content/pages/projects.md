PieAdmin gets you an admin panel & SQL reports & dashboards in just a few
minutes. You enter your connection credentials and select which tables and
files to show on the list, details and edit page and you are done.

With the reports feature it's easy to quickly write some SQL query to answer
that burning question you have (it even has a reference of your whole database
schema on the right hand side). You can then visualize the results in a table,
number or chart format.

Once you have a few interesting SQL reports you can arrange them in a dashboard
and make sure they run on a schedule, like, every hour for you to keep a eye
on your important metrics.
