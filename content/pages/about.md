Hi there! I am Frederic Gingras.

**A web developer who values less code, building software that ages well and thoughtfully
designed code boundaries. I am not fanboy of any specific tool or language but more of
the right tool for the job and being able to ship quickly.**

I currently live in Toronto, Canada but am often seen travelling in Europe or the East Coast.

## Me

I have an ever-growing passion for programming (especially for the web and servers powering it).
The seemingly endless array of learning opportunities programming brings is amazing. Since my
first bits of HTML and PHP when I was 15 years old I kept growing and learning every day with
no end in sight.

I am mostly **self-taught** as all programmers are, but did a college degree that's CS related
before deciding to skip on University. I attribute most of my knowledge and skills to the
_relentless book reading, technology trying, hackathon attending, side-project hacking and
challenging work opportunities_ not school.

I pride myself in being a well-rounded T-shaped person with professional experience doing
**back-end** work and more recently heavy **front-end** work. But I love diving into
design, systems administration, systems programming, compilers, interpreters and databases
in my free time. I value results and working code over a specific tool or methodology.

## Work experience

_Previously, (March 2018 - September 2016)_ I worked at **Block Capital**,
a very small hedge fund in the crypto space. There I got to work the very
early stages or a trading platform and market neutral trading algorithm.
Being on a developer team of 2 and working directly with traders on building
out algorithms to trade the crypto markets on many exchanges I spend a lot
of time prototyping, doing research, delving into quantitative finance math
and dealing with a multitude of APIs (of wildly varying quality). The
technology stack we were working with was Golang, PostgreSQL, Redis and
Ember.js for our frontend needs. It pushed me to further my user interface
building skill as monitoring trading algorithms and live markets requires you
not only to handle a lot of data comming in over websocket but also display
a lot of information in a very ergonimic way as money is on the line if any
information is misread or misunderstood.

_Previously, (February 2017 -  March 2018)_ I working at **Wave** as a
Fullstack Developer. As part of a team called _Banking Services_ I maitained
existing and built new services. The scale of Wave's customer base is pretty
impressive, with more than 2 million signed up users, service and database
design required careful consideration of the load they had to withstand.
Dealing with baking integrations we had to wrestle with a wide range of APIs
going from REST ones using deprecated versions of OAuth to big old SOAP ones
with the megabytes of XML schemas and quirks they come with.
The technology stack I worked with was Python paired with Django and PostgreSQL,
as every engineer is expected to be at easy working on frontend and backend
projects we also happenned to write a lot of React.js/JavaScript when working
on the user interfaces our team was responsible for. Seeing how an individual
can fit in a thightly knit team and how a team can fit in a large engineering
organization (>100 developers) was enlightening.

_Previously, (January 2016 - November 2016)_ I worked at **Plot.ly** as
senior front-end developer coding and maintaining a large React.js and Redux codebase.
While at Plotly I spearheaded an effort to standardize and rewrite a large portion
of the current web application pages and functionally so that we had consistency in
style and robustness going forward. I also built new features like the dashboard
creation app with advanced drag-n-drop and mouse based resizing.

_Previously, (June 2015 - February 2016)_ I did contract work helping small businesses
either launch or improve their SaaS products under the **Atriumph** name.

_Previously, (November 2014 - June 2015)_ I worked for **Busbud** as a
back-end developer. Over there I wore a few hats working on diverse projects
mostly API work with Node.js, some front-ends for internal tools and being
the go-to operations guys managing AWS servers with Ansible & Terraform.

_Previously, (September 2011 - September 2014)_ I worked for a small web-agency
named **Ankedotes Communication** as a web-developer
shipping custom built e-commerces and creating an in house framework and modules.
Those where very formative years in terms of client interaction, estimating, project
scope, architecting project so that the age well and stay easy to change. I build
all kinds: inventory management, service request forms, dynamic sliders and animations,
e-commerce functionalities and all kind of back office tools for small local businesses.
