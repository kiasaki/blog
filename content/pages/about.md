Hi there, my name is Frederic and I am a web developer! I am currently a 20 yrs.
old and barely student mostly hacker living in ~~the south shore of Montreal~~
~~the heart of Montreal, Canada~~ around Europe.
Yes this nice header picture is my home city at night :P

I have an ever-growing passion for the web all the learning possibilities around
it since I was 15 years old, more specifically for the programming, thinking and
solving hard problems aspect of it. I am a self-learner and can't stop reading
about new things, trying out new technologies, databases, languages, libraries, etc.
The universe of the web is so large and filled with interesting things to do,
with the years I have grown to be a talented  __backend developer__ but over the
years I ended up reading and becoming quite good at front-end work (by extension
a little of design) and quite knowledgeable with what's related to entrepreneurship
and startups.

I am currently "nomading" around Europe while running a
solo-consultancy named [Atriumph](https://www.atriumph.com) taking contract work
with software companies or startups looking to launch and/or grow. **I usually
quote on a per project basis and don't do staff augmentation. I am currently
booked till beginning of November 2015.**

Previously, (November 2014 - June 2015) I worked at a super duper cool Montreal
based startup called __Busbud__ as a developer. Wearing a few hats and working
on multiple projects but mostly doing back-end work, some front-end features
here and there and actively learning the SysAdmin ropes and implementing DevOps
in a growing team. Lots of fun!

Previously, (September 2014 - November 2014) I was going to school part time.
I was searching for a new home in which I could grow, discuss, argument, and
work with interesting peers, anywhere in the WORLD!

Previously, (September 2011 - September 2014) I worked for [Ankedotes Communication](http://anekdotes.com/)
