Hi! I am Frederic Gingras.

A web developer who values less code, quality software and good design. I am not
fanboy of any specific tool or language but more of the right tool for the job
and being able to ship quickly.

I currently live in Montreal, Canada but am often seen travelling in Europe.
Working mostly remotely as a [consultant](http://atriumph.com).

-----

I have an ever-growing passion for programming (especially the web) all the
learning possibilities around it since I was 15 years old. I am self-taught
and can't stop learning new things, trying out new technologies, databases,
languages, libraries, etc.

I pride myself in being a well-rounded T-shape person doing mostly **back-end** work
and still be knowledgeable in front-end development, systems administration,
systems programming, minimal designer and database architect.

-----

I currently do contract work as [Atriumph](https://www.atriumph.com) helping
software companies and startups create great applications people love to use.

Previously, (November 2014 - June 2015) I worked at a fairly large startup called
__Busbud__ as a back-end developer. Over there I wore a few hats working on
diverse projects mostly api work, some front-ends for internal tools and being
the go-to operations guys managing AWS with Ansible & Terraform.

Previously, (September 2011 - September 2014) I worked for a small web-agency
named [Ankedotes Communication](http://anekdotes.com/) as a web-developper
shipping custom build e-commerces and creating an in house framework and modules.
