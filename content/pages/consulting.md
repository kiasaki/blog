**Software is hard**, not only hiring or even just finding an consultant is difficult but so many
software projects end up _costing a lot_, _being delayed_ and _shiping already broken_ or filled
with bugs.

> The normal for software is cost overruns, time delays and broken promises.
>
> **I aim to help you minimize those three factors so you get a working solution shipped and fast.**

Over the years I grew to really love being able to cover a lot of ground as a developer. This includes
reading up on UX, Entrepreneurship, Lean/Agile, Design, DevOps on top of solid backend and frontend
coding chops. At the same time, I practiced and _always feel the most productive_ when bringing
something to life from ground zero over a short period of time, hackathon style, we could say this
is where I thrive.

## What I'll do for you

- **1. Map:** We'll start by defining what is your end goal, what are you looking to get done, what
  results are you seeking
- **2. Ideate:** We'll throw ideas around about the different angles that can be taken to achieve the
  wanted goals or results, spend time remixing them and improving them until they are clear pros and
  cons for each.
- **3. Decide:** We'll one of the plans of attack together and plan it out in more details while keeping
  and eye for alternatives that might end up being better as we dig deeper.
- **4. Build:** The fun part, here we'll get busy building and implementing a solution. We'll get to
  see things coming together pretty quickly and will steer and make corrections as we iterate.
- **5. Launch:** We'll plan, double check and triple check we are ready to go live and have tracking
  implemented so we can measure the impact of the MVP or feature.
- **6. Learn:** We'll retrospect on the outcome of the launch and discuss about the possible next steps.

### Expertise

- Backend (Node.js, Go)
- Frontend (React, Backbone, Webpack/ES6, & more)
- Databases (PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, ElasticSearch)
- Linux/Unix server administration
- Cloud and infrastructure

### Also...

- I do short term engagements on building a defined MVP or feature
- I mostly work with early-stage startups and small businesses
- I can come on-site, which is preferable when possible
- I try and only help startups that use technologies I have experience with, that way I ensure
  that I can actually deliver a solution quickly and that you pay me to execute on a plan not learn
  and debug

## What I expect from you

First and foremost the kind of engagements I take are short but intense, meaning you will need to have
someone from your team available for me to collaborate with. You need someone I can ask questions to,
bounce ideas with and make decisions fast. Given that you can provide me with someone like that, we
should be able to achieve great results together.

## Rate and availability

My next availability is: **February 2016**

My rate is **$6,000 per week**. I bill weekly for projects with vague requirements but try and bill a
fixed price when projects have clear requirements.

I am the right person for you. Talk to you soon!
