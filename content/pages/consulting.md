**Software is hard**. Finding a competent consultant is difficult
and even once you've found one software projects often end up _going over budget_, _taking longer than expected_, and _shipping with bugs_.

> **I aim to help you build a solid foundation for future improvements. We'll make sure we build the right solution, efficiently, and enable you to learn from your users.**

Over the years, I've gotten to work with startups of all sizes, as an employee and as a consultant. This has led me to develop skills in UX design, lean thinking, agile methodologies, systems administration, on top of a strong full-stack knowledge. Additionally, this has given me first-hand experience starting projects and features from scratch.

## What I'll do for you

- **1. Map:** We'll start from the big picture and define expected outcomes
- **2. Ideate:** We'll brainstorm ideas, from practical to outlandish, identifying pros and cons for each.
- **3. Decide:** We'll select the top ideas and refine them further.
- **4. Build:** We'll start building a solution iteratively, making corrections as we go, until we get to...
- **5. Launch:** We'll double and triple check that we're ready to go live. We'll ensure that we have CI set up, deployment working, analytics installed, monitoring enabled, and security accounted for.
- **6. Learn:** We'll do a retrospective on the outcome of the launch and discuss the next steps.
