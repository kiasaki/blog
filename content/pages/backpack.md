title = "Frederic's Backpack"
+++

Hey there! Interested in knowing what I carry around when traveling? I
maintain a list of what goes into my backpack over here for you too
look at.

I grew this list from 0 to _some big number_ in April 2014 and now I am
downsizing it slowly. At the moment I have 56 items on it :D , or at
least on this page, there are other small thing that are come and go but
are non-essential, like, lip-balm, winter boots in winter, kleenexes,
throwable razors... Those thing I either buy at destination or are seasonal.

If you have a nice pack too, don't be shy and hit me up
with a link to it, I link to geek out on those and see what people judge
essential to their travels and lifestyles.
