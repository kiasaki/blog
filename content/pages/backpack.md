Hey there! Interested in knowing what I carry around when traveling? I
maintain a list of what goes into my backpack over here for you too
look at.

I grew this list from 0 to _some big number_ in April 2014 and now I am
downsizing it slowly. At the moment I have 48 items on it. A few situational
or seasonal items I'll get at destination (like kleenexes, advil, winter gear).

If you have a nice pack too, don't be shy and hit me up with a link to it, I
link to geek out on those and see what people judge essential to their travels
and lifestyles.
