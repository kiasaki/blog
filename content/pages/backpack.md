title = "Frederic's Backpack"
+++

Hey there!, interested in knowing what I lug around while traveling? I
maintain a list of what goes into my backpack right over here for you too
look at/drool over as we all like to do :P

I grew this list from 0 to _some big number_ in April 2014 and now I am
downsizing it slowly. At the moment I have 56 items on it :D , or at
least on this page, there are other small thing that are come and go but
are non-essential, like, lip-balm, winter boots in winter, kleenexes,
throwable razor... Those thing I either buy in place or are seasonal.

If you have a nice pack too, don't be afraid, hit me up, send me an email
with a link to it, I link to geek out on this and see what people judge
essential to their travels and lifestyles. (You how gear shopping is like
porn for travellers ;) )
