  I help small B2B SaaS products deliver value to their clients faster.
</h2>

Unlike most developers that worry about the code they write, the abstractions they use,
the frameworks they've chosen, I recognise the importance of all of these without
making them my sole purpose. **I focus on your target customers, I work with you on
figuring out if we are shipping the _right_ feature. I work with you on making sure
that existing features and new features actually work and deliver value, not _headaches_.**

Like any senior full-stack developer, I care for writing clean, readable and performant code.
I care for tested code that avoids future breakage. I care for delivering on time. **However,
I understand that code is simply means to an end.**

If you want a product:

- whose user interface doesn’t look like it was built by a back-end developer
- that is easy to change and iterate on by using automated deployment
- that is built with scalability in mind but without being over-engineered
- that is safeguarded by an automated test suite
- that can be easily handed over to existing developers in your company

… and you need a lead developer:

- whose primary focus is on delivering a slick, reliable experience for your users rather
than obsessing about code or frameworks
- who will guide you on business as well as technology areas
- who you can trust to work directly with your users and other stakeholders
- who is comfortable writing front-end code as much as designing a database as much as setting up servers and infrastructure
- who can mentor junior developers and work hand-in-hand with your existing team

… then I can help.

Unlike other full-stack developers, I have significant founder, product management and operational experience from being CTO of a SaaS business ([CrewFire](https://crewfire.com/)). This helps me ensure you that we will build together matches business goals. I won’t waste time building stuff that your business doesn't need.
