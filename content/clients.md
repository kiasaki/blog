**Project Type:** Building an MVP for a new SaaS business<br/>
**Technologies:** `Node.js`, `MongoDB`, `React.js`, `Riot.js`, `Stripe`

_I helped Testimonial Guard build and launch their SaaS business in less than 6 weeks. The platform is a multi-tenant Node.js application with multiple external components and a billing system that integrates with Stripe._

The Testimonial Guard founders had been through a lot before contacting me. They started out with a technical partner but after a few months that person left. Following that, they mandated a web agency at first, the progress came in quick but slowed to a crawl when they started working on the hard parts of the application, when the agency started started asking for more money, Testimonial Guard decided to find somebody else.

The goals were clear, the features needed for launch where thought through, Testimonial Guard simply wanted to hit the market fast while still having a solid foundation on which they could easily add features and that's exactly what we delivered.
