When I pronounce the 3 letters, PHP, in front of all kinds of languages affectionados, rubyists, pythonistas, javascripters but also in front of full time PHP developers there is that sudden disgust apearing in their face.

Hey, it's 2014, wake up. And you PHP developer, don't be ashamed, stand straight and be proud and back up your everyday language.

_... ok, sorry, that was maybee a bit strong ..._

There is nuance to be made with that statement:

PHP has changed a lot and it now has various really [well written](http://thephpleague.com/) [packages](https://github.com/laravel/) and really [cool](http://taylorotwell.com/) [evangelists](https://twitter.com/fabpot), [community leaders](https://philsturgeon.uk/) and [production](http://flickr.com) [apps](https://facebook.com) [using](http://wikipedia.com) it, nice language featuresgetting released but,

**buuut**, it has a bad reputation beacuse of few things, the language has not evolved well and has no real future plans, people don't upgrade to the latest version fast, a lot of opensource codebases support legacy features / don't adopt new syntax but more importantly, 90% of google searches related to PHP yields decade old answers with bad practices leading beginners in writing aweful code.

I agree that few years ago PHP was not looking good but nowadays you can build about any applications as you would in _Ruby_, _Python_ or _Node.js_.

- There is a package manager: [https://getcomposer.org/](https://getcomposer.org/)
- Here you can browse availble packages: [https://packagist.org/](https://packagist.org/)
- There is a Rails/Django equivalent: [http://laravel.com/](http://laravel.com/)
- There is even language alternatives if you are starving for staticly typed code: [http://hacklang.org/](http://hacklang.org/)
- There is good testing libraries: [https://phpunit.de/](https://phpunit.de/)
- Nice Jinja like templating languages: [http://twig.sensiolabs.org/](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/)
- An asset manager: [https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic)
- A good _Redis_ library: [https://github.com/nrk/predis](https://github.com/nrk/predis)
- Nice and updated literature on [https://leanpub.com/](https://leanpub.com/c/software) and [http://phptherightway.com/](http://www.phptherightway.com/)

That's it! End of rant. Have a great day, enjoy your good coffee/tea, think about other prejudices.
