The importance in the title is on the word _choose_, because, yes, it's a choice. I read many stories of people who visited X number of countries or did that big round the world trip and still continue to travel frequently getting told by people wishing for that kind of experience: "If only I could afford doing like you, but, yunno, not everybody can take 2-3 months of vacation". Well my dear friend doing 75K a year with 2 cars in the driveway and a nice mortgage it's your choices that have put you in this position, the good news is, you can start now to make choices bringing you closer to what you dream of. If that happens to be travel that so be it. It's all about goals and priorities.

It seems there is a whole suite of choices made for you that you are expected to follow, just because that's how it's done, that's what everybody does, it's the norm. But you know what, you still have control, so many things part of the population's subconscious are crafted by marketing and not actually benefic for you. You can do what you want, as long as it does arm others. As _Chris Guillebeau_ exposed it so well with his list of _"11 ways to be unremarkably average"_ containing the following:

1. Accept what people tell you at face value
2. Don't question authority
3. Go to college because you are supposed to, not because you want to learn something
4. Go oversees once or twice in your life somewhere safe like England
5. Don't try to learn an other language, every one else will eventually learn English
6. Think about starting your own business but never do it
7. Think about writing a book but never do it
8. Get the largest mortgage you qualify for and spend 30 years paying for it
9. Sit at a desk 40 hours a week for an average of 10 hours of productive work
10. Don't stand out or draw attention to yourself
11. Jump though the hoops. Check off the boxes

The people you see living a passionate life doing things you wish you could be doing too didn't get there by luck, but, by having it as a goal (consciously or inconsciously). They then took that goal seriously by taking small steps towards it right from the beginning.

I understand it's not easy to change. Change is such a big source of fear, but, if you force yourself to start moving towards your ideal life, you will start to see momentum building up and building up and if you keep going that will be you biggest motivator, everything will be made easier by the simple fact that you have progress under your belt.

We tend to vastly overestimate how much we can accomplish in a day and vastly underestimate how much we can achieve in a year. Shush that inner voice telling that it's seems like the impossible, the time to act is NOW, nobody else will do it for you. Blaming people, events, conditions, weather for your inertia wont change anything, and, change, is what you want.
