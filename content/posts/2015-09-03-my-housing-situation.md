Nowadays I always try to consider all my options, especially including the uncommon ones, even more when it comes to lifestyle choices.

At the moment I am torn apart in terms of choosing a place to live from. I have quite a few options, some common, some uncommon, some expensive, some cheap, some classy, some less desirable. I hope it gives you ideas of what is possible.

Let's explore some options you might be faced with:

- __Rent an apartment in a Canadian city center (Montreal)__
  <br>Price: __4/10__ &mdash; Comfort: __6/10__
  <br>*Advantages:* Developed city, your own apartment, affordable (~900-1100$CAD/m). Personally: I know the city and have friends there.
  <br>*Disadvantages:* Can't cancel 12 month bail easily, not many travel destination close without crossing the ocean.
- __Rent an apartment in an eastern European city center (Warsaw)__
  <br>Price: __6/10__ &mdash; Comfort: __7/10__
  <br>*Advantages:* Developed city, your own apartment, can travel easily to the whole Europe, cost of life can be cheaper than in the West.Personally: I get to learn more Polish.
  <br>*Disadvantages:* Getting pretty costly, again, commit for 12 months renting the place.
- __Take AirBnB's where I want 1 month at a time__
  <br>Price: __7/10__ (can vary) &mdash; Comfort: __4__
  <br>*Advantages:* You get to see many cultures, there are some nice AirBnB but I still not like owning the place, you don't have fixed commitment, travel to new places as you wish.
  <br>*Disadvantages:* No stability can be exhausting, difficult to get something cheap that also looks nice in most Western cities, not that comfortable as you constantly feel you are living in someone else's things.
- __Stay in hotels suites /w a kitchenette on long-term stay prices__
  <br>Price: __10/10__ &mdash; Comfort: __8__
  <br>*Advantages:* You live the high life/feel jet-set. Suites are really nice, they often include cleaning, internet, access to a gym, front desk 24/7. No commitment. You get to see many cities. Often really well located in cities.
  <br>*Disadvantages:* Extremely costly (for my means), north of 3000$/month. Tiring to always move. Feels really temporary as, well, it's an hotel!
- __Buy a small apartment in the greater area of an Eastern European city (Warsaw)__
  <br>Price: __5/10__ &mdash; Comfort: __9/10__
  <br>*Advantages:* Best value for the money. It's an investment, not simply giving you money away. Good for permanence/stability. In Europe so nice for travelling to neighbouring countries. Really nice to live from as it's yours you can renovate and furnish as you like.
  <br>*Disadvantages:* Long term commitment (I guess you could sublet). A bit less fun than living in the center. You still pay for it when you make a trip elsewhere.
- __Stay at parents or friends place__
  <br>Price: __1/10__ &mdash; Comfort: __3/10__
  <br>*Advantages:* Really cheap.
  <br>*Disadvantages:* Often not close to the city center, often not even in a city you'd like to be in. At best temporary. Doesn't feel like home. You don't want to bother your hosts with your presence for too long.
- __Camping in state parks, sleeping in your car or tent__
  <br>Price: __3/10__ &mdash; Comfort: __2/10__
  <br>*Advantages:* Pretty cheap. Makes you see tons of amazing landscapes. Access to outdoor activities.
  <br>*Disadvantages:* Finding WIFI is your constant quest, or, stay in 4G range and pay a bunch! Living conditions/standards lower than when living in a house for sure, but I can deal with this, I think. Eating personal hygiene occupies a good part of you day. You feel isolated and lonely pretty quickly.
- __Living on trains /w a monthly pass__
  <br>Price: __3/10__ &mdash; Comfort: __1/10__
  <br>*Advantages:* Not costly at all. Can be fun at start. You get to see many cities. You can meet many people every day. You see nice landscapes in the viewing cart, if there's one.
  <br>*Disadvantages:* You are always siting. Personal hygiene is more tricky. Your food choices are limited if you don't get off often. You don't really build any stable friendships. You can get bored of it quickly, I guess.
- __Living in planes and airport lounges__
  <br>Price: __1/10__ or __10/10__ &mdash; Comfort: __5/10__
  <br>*Advantages:* Living the jet-set life
  <br>*Disadvantages:* Far from a permanent living situation. Rough on your body. You must be a hell of a travel hacker to pull it off. Still no kitchen and stable friendships.

I am still debating and researching many of there. I might do an update post when I settle on an option.
