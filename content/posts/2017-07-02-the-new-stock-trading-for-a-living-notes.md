_I recently read this book called [The New Trading for a Living: Psychology, Discipline, Trading Tools and Systems, Risk Control, Trade Management](http://a.co/ccHFkGV)
by **Alexander Elder** and a friend of mine asked for some notes on it, so
that's what this blog post is about._

## Introduction

### The triangle of trading

![Trading Triangle](/images/posts/tntfal-triangle.png)

Those 3 main concepts plus the encompassing Learning + Record Keeping are what
this books treats about and represents the most important facets of trading for
a living.

### Dangers

Trading is super hard but also super dangerous. There is no guarantees, nothing
stopping you from self destruction.

A few wins in a row will make an inexperienced trader feel like a genius,
thinking he figured the stock market out. _Correlation is not causation_. He'll
then take riskier bets or change his method both avenues leading to loosing
everything he gained up till now.

### Approach trading as the AA's (Alcoholics Anonymous)

There are 3 rules of the AA's you can learn from in regards to trading:

- **Denial** &rarr; If your account is spinning out of control, do something, stop,
  reflect, don't deny it.
- **Rock Bottom** &rarr; Some times people have to hit rock bottom to realize they
  have a problem, they are obsessed with winning, with gambling, that addiction
  is not called trading, it's not being a professional.
- **One day at the time** &rarr; After a big loss, looking at the whole picture,
  at the huge $ amount you just lost, at the time it will take to rebuild can be
  really depressing. Being in that depressed state can just hinder your recovery.
  Take it one day at the time, start with a blank slate every day, that's more
  manageable.

Trading while keeping losses below a business margin (read a maximum number you
defined like 6%/month or 2%/trade) is like staying sober. Letting any loss get
bigger than that is gambling / getting drunk.

> Emotional trading is a luxury nobody can afford.

### Rules to become calm expert consistent trader:

1. Decide that you are in it for the long run. 20+ years.
1. Learn as much as you can (while keeping a healthy amount of skepticism).
1. Do not get greedy and rush to trading. Take time to learn. Markets and
  opportunities will always be there.
1. Develop a method for analysing markets ("If A happens, then B generally
  follows") keeping in mind that markets are multi-dimensional, use multiple
  analysis techniques. The way you trade might be different in a bull, bear,
  sideways market.
1. Define a money management plan. Your primary goal is long term survival.
  Second goal is steady growth of capital, Third goal is high profits (3rd is
  not more important than 1st).
1. The trader itself is the weakest link in any trading system.
1. Winners think, feel, and act differently than losers. Becoming a professional
  will require you to change, to evolve (you don't start out as a winner).

### Mass Psychology

- **Bull** &rarr; _Buys_, hopes for rises in price
- **Bear** &rarr; _Sells_, hopes for fall in price
- **Hog** &rarr; Takes on too big/risky positions for their accounts.
- **Sheep** &rarr; Undecided, not quite a bull not quite a bear, loser

> In trading you compete against the brightest minds in th world fending off
> piranhas of commissions and slippage.

Crowds are powerful, they may be dumb at times but don't go against the trend.
If a stock is rallying (read going up) buy or stand aside, don't sell short
because "prices are too high", mass mania is a thing that happens.

Group thinking exists. Advisers and Guru's will make you feel like an insider.
Group members might catch a few trends but they get killed when the trend
reverses. **Successful traders are independant thinkers**.

Successful trading stands on 3 pillars:

- Analysing balance of power between bulls and bears
- Good money management
- Personal discipline to follow a trading plan. Avoid getting high or depressed
  by the market.

> Plan the trade then trade the plan.

## Charts

### The meaning of a bar chart

> Each price is a monetary consensus of value of all market participants
> expressed in action.

- (Day/Week) **Opening prices** &rarr; tend to reflect amateurs opinion of value
- (Day/Week) **Closing prices** &rarr; tend to reflect actions of professionals

In a bull market Monday and Tuesday are usually down or low rallying up on
Thursday and Friday.

In a bear market it's the opposite. High at the start, lower at the end of the
week.

### Theories

_I touch quickly on those as they are important history but not so practical,
read up more on them if you are interested)_

- Efficient market theory (Notion that nobody can outperform the market because
  any price at any given moment incorporates all available information. Problem
  is there are quite a few examples of people beating the market using the fact
  that the humans putting in the trades are imperfect and irrational at times)
- Random Walk (Claims prices changes at random, true to an extent on the short
  term but there are people placing trades and they have memories which leads to
  recognizable patterns)
- Chaos Theory (Similar to random walk)
- Nature's Law (Mystics who think there is some perfect order in the market.
  See R. N. Elliot)

### Support and Resistance

> Support and resistance exists because people have memories.

- **Support** &mdash; level where there's enough buying interest that when a
  downtrend hits it, it reverses. (Drawn as a horizontal line connecting lows)
- **Resistance** &mdash; The opposite of Support.

When the market rallies sharply / quickly:

- Bears feel the pain as they are short and will **BUY** at the first dip.
- Bulls feel bad not having bought more shares and will **BUY** at first dip.

This goes on until an old/new resistance level is met and bear think the equity
is overvalued and bulls see the price as too high for it's potential gain.

The inverse happens with sharp dips in price, a lot of **SELLing** leading to
sharper decline in price.

Strength of support and resistance is composed of: length (sideways / time),
height (compared to other r/s levels) and volume (of interest).

### Trading rules for Resistance and Support

1. Use tighter protective stops when approaching resistance / support line. If
  the price reverses/bounces you'll still reap in most of the profit.
1. Support and Resistance are more important in longterm charts than short term.
1. Support and Resistance points are trading opportunities.

**On placing stops:** place them on uneven numbers a bit higher when shorting or
lower when long so that the masses using round numbers for stop losses trigger
first and potentially reverses the trend, avoiding you exiting with a loss.

False breakouts (read breaking through a resistance or support level) usually
have normal volume and don't affect technical indicators, true breakouts will
have huge volume.

### The right hand edge

Hindsight is 20/20. Spotting trends in historical charts is easy. Unfortunately
your broker wont allow you to trade in the past, you trade at the right edge of
a chart where everything is more foggy and technical indicators are not as clear.
Professional traders know they'll make mistakes, they cut their losses quick.
