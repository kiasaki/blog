Hello, as the title explicitly anounces, this is my first blog post, I have never really been good at writing those regular blog post but I have figured our that writting stuff down on what you are currently learning really helps securing thoses lessons in your gray matter.

So stay tuned for posts.

By the way for the little curious folks out there this is an [octopress](http://octopress.org) blog hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/). Why? Because static websites are geeky and stuff you know.
