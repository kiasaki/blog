I know I am like that and from few blogs I read recently and conversations I’ve had recently I know there is plenty of other people like this. People with and insatiable quench for learning, for new knowledge.

This feeling is even more prevalent in the IT field where, I you sit on what you acquired up till now, even for just 3 months, you have quite a bit of catching up to do. In other fields with less constant newness it feel less of an imperative but it is as important as for anybody else.

I am infinitely grateful for what I have accomplished and where I am at but when people say I am lucky or ask me simply, how?, I always answer:

> It’s simple, to become a world-class performer you need to never stop doing two things: put in hours and constantly surpass your limits (even if just by a little)

And that second part is what makes it possible for someone with 5 years to be 10x better than someone with 20 years of experience. What makes you better and better is what researchers call _deliberate practice_, the act of practicing over and over what’s core to your skill or craft, it’s not the fun part like a piano concert but that part that people call _grinding_, playing the same piano song over and over while paying attention to what you are doing wrong and on what you can improve.

The act of deliberate practice can seem like daunting to you and I know what you mean, I played piano when I was younger and as much as I **hated practicing**. I was exhilarated by the end result, the playing the song you learn’t in front of friends in family. What I am getting to is that I eventually stopped playing piano, but, with hacking, programming, I can never get enough of it. Deliberate practice feels fun, I always want more of it, and, in terms, I am even more impressed with the outcomes and end results of my constant learning. And that is **what you should search for**, something that you have a passion for big enough that the parts of it that are boring to other exhilarate you and passionate you.

Go and find that, I you found it already then enjoy and build great things!
