I am writing this, wishing for more time in life. Would it be nice it day's had 48 hours? I know it won't happen so let's be realistic, sleep is really overrated, right?

No, I can't compromise on normal sleep hours, did it too many times and I know it all comes back to you. Karma's a bitch.

I am writing this not wishing for more idea's to write about, not even for a huge audience that follows my adventures but for time to stop and write. I know how important it is to maintain a blog, especially as you are learning new things. And in the __World Wide Web__ you are constantly learning.

I'd like to thank __Ben Orenstein ([r00k](https://twitter.com/r00k))__ for inspiring me this writing importance and for the _awsome_ poscasts he puts out every week at __thoughtbot__.

Expect an other post!
