That is it, today marks, yet again, the beginning of a new chapter in my life.
I have decided to send in my resignation letter to Busbud. I am forward to be
helping startups launch and grow faster than ever and also, take some time to
give back more to open source and work on ideas I have been excited about for a
while now.

Over the past few years I have amassed experience and learned TONS about many
spheres of programming and I deeply enjoy doing it. But, while that hunger for
growth, results and challenging projects really makes me improve fast it also
has the downside of making slow moving environments and teams places I don't
want to stay in long.

The other thing is that, there are so many things we all dream of doing one day
but at the same time a majority of us go and sell half of our days to one company
that often ends up making us come back home mentally exhausted and thats where,
instead of working on projects that we wish we get to spend time on, we end up
defaulting to consumerism, watching Netflix and doing anything that doesn't feel
like it takes effort.

So, with that in mind, I am headed to Europe for a "one-way" / "no-return-date-planned"
travel with the goal of attending to more conferences, meet more peers, work with
interesting companies remotely and be a nomad living out of a backpack.

Let the adventure begin!
