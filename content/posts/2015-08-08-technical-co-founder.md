For the past six years I have been mostly focusing on becoming an awesome developer,
constantly learning new languages and technologies, working for a few different
companies. But, the past month, everything changed, I became a
[consultant](http://atriumph.com) and started working on a per contract basis.
And wow does that involve a whole new skill set: marketing, networking,
designing my image, accounting, relationships, time tracking and plenty more!

As much as I adore the lifestyle it enables and the time I now have for side
projects there is one oblivious truth that surfaces (don't worry I am coming
co-founders): I am far from being as productive, focused and growing of a
programmer than before.

You see, those added responsabilities of running a business really occupy my mind,
I have more trouble getting "in the zone". Now this becomes even more prevalent
when you add up the additional challenges/responsabilities of running a startup.

That is where, if you start a business with two partners, you have the advantage
of the possibility of a clear separation in roles and a clear focused mind when
at work. This especially important as a startups most valuable resource is time.

With that in mind,

**The technical co-founder brings:**

- Knowledge of best technologies to tackle X or Y problem
- Experience building products from scratch
- Estimation of feasability of different features/projects
- Estimation of time it would take to build X feature/project
- Initial workforce to build the startup's application
- Knowledge of what is a good hire when it comes time to subcontract/employ someone
- Often he will also be somewhat of a designer, UX guy and project manager.
- Deals/Talks to technology partners

**The other co-founder brings:**

- Domain knowledge related to the business you are starting
- Domain experience and knowledge of clients needs
- Takes on the initial marketing role
- Attend to networking events and generally gets the word out
- Constantly gathers client feedback and thinks of adjustments that can be made to the product to delight them
- Tries different acquisition channels
- Handles client relationships


**And, together they both:**

- Define the goals of the startup
- Define features that are musts and other that are nice idea for the future
- Talk about design decisions and how to delight users more generally
- Go fund-raising when it's time and if it's right for them
- Moral support!

_TL; DR;_ For any startup time is their most valuable resource, it's their life
blood at the beginning, they need to optimize it's usage. So, two partners starting
a business should aim to maximize the time spent by the technical co-founder,
head down, building their product. While, the other co-founder, aims to
constantly readjust trajectory/features to fit client needs from feedback gathered
and, more generally, build up traction, acquire new users.
