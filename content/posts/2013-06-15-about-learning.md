I can't really speak for other domains but, of what I know, in the IT domain you need to
keep learning, **constantly**.

It's not required from your boss, you won't be paid for it, but, at the pace the web and
the technology world evolves, you will be behind many others in even just 6 months. That is
why you need to see those hours spent a home learning new stuff or just keeping yourself
updated like an investment.

That said you need to make it fun, as evrything in life. If it bothers you in anyway to
pickup a programming book or read blog posts and follow tutorials you are doing it wrong.

So here are, from my point of view, the prerequisites:

> **A love for your domain, what you do**<br/>
> may it be managing servers, designing or programming

<br/>

> **Ambition**<br/>
> Being the best at your current job is not enough. you can mesure yourself to the
> **whole world (wide web)**

<br/>

> **Time**<br/>
> Yes I know everything needs your precious time but you need to make some, same thing as
> for your exercising you'll never go jog if you do not reserve it a time in your day. Do
> the same for learning.

Following the same mindset here is what I am learning right now:

- **Rails**<br/>
  I am tired of working with decade old technologies or simply working with
  languages/frameworks without comunity. Rails has a vibrant comunity, ongoing development,
  and on top of it: it's open source. The mind set is completly diferrent, code I produce
  in *ASP Classic* is tiring to write, tiring to debug, tiring to re-read a year later, *Ruby*
  code is fun readable and testable, if I put my *Rails* project on *Github* I can even get
  help from anybody out there, and that is great.

- **TDD**<br/>
  As a disclaimer, *TDD* is difficult, wrinting it demands a little bit of thinking. But,
  I think that is exactly what makes it so good for your codebase, before writting any
  models or domain logic you think, what do I really want in the end?

  I am still a complete beginner but having done the complete `outside-in` technique with
  cucumber and RSpec in the context of an API endpoint I can clearly see the benefits of it.
  (as explained [here](http://blog.carbonfive.com/2012/02/14/beginning-outside-in-rails-development-with-cucumber-and-rspec/))

- **Backbone.js / Angular.js**<br/>
  I'll just say keywords about SPA's:
  - Snappy
  - API powered
  - The future
  - Organized
  - Way better UX (User experience)
