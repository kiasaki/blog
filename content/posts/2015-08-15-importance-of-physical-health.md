Health and more generally less technical subjects are not talked about that much
among programmer (and more generally people working in front of a computer daily).
Don't you think this is a bit weird, the people who would get the most benefit out
of good ergonomics and healthy habits are the least exposed to it. Although, this
is changing slowly.

As you may have came to realize, taking care of your body and health is central
to your daily mental performance, focus and tiredness, in terms, impacting your
happiness doing your work.

This blog post is a try at putting together a short list of simple habits / things
to look out for daily to instantly improve your health.

For most of the items that follow, the very best way to approach implementing one of them in your daily life is to track whether or not you followed them using a spreadsheet.

(I just started doing so not so long ago and it really helps)

Read up on the [Bulletproof Diet](https://www.bulletproofexec.com/) it's not
so far from the Paleo Diet, only, with a little bigger list of food to avoid and
tons more good fats (especially butter). To explain it quickly, it's a diet that
promotes mainly eating raw foods, so, a lot of vegetables and meat in enough
quantities so that you aren't hungry anymore, plus, it add a special concoction
called bullet proof coffee and promotes fasting from 8pm to 12-13 the next day,
only having that special coffee for breakfast. Benefits range from: easy to stick
with as everything is yummy, makes you loose fat with almost no workout and feeds
your body all the best. The best part is that it's built on years of scientific
research and bio-hacking not on common sense, grandma's saying of companies
marketing efforts.

Stand up and stretch, move around a little, do jumping jacks, push ups each
30 minutes. Your body will thanks you 100 times in the long run, plus, your
focus will be instantly improved.

Next up is a really general "no non-sense", "the less the merrier", list of
things to avoid as much as possible (here tracking with a spreadsheet really
helps staying accountable).

- No smoking
- No Alcohol
- No Sugar
- No dairy, soda, carbohydrates (mostly), fruits (in too big quantities or the morning), [...](https://www.bulletproofexec.com/the-complete-illustrated-one-page-bulletproof-diet/)
- No porn, masturbation, orgasm (more on that in the next point)

---

No PMO; In other words stop watching porn, masturbating and orgasming as often
as you do at the moment. Again, a lot of research has gone into this and you wont
believe the consequences of doing it / benefits of abstaining. You may have heard
of the nofap movement on reddit, well it's not so far from that but applied to
anybody. A good source of information on this subject is a website/book called
[Your Brain On Porn](http://yourbrainonporn.com/).

Meditate daily, meta-cognition really helps you improve. Here, [HeadSpace](https://www.headspace.com) helps.

---

Writing or journaling as this meta-cognition moment when you are writing makes you internalize the lessons you had during the day, the new things you learned and realize what progress you did.

---

Reading, more generally learning constantly.
