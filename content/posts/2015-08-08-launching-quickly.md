I have now been reading startup related books for quite a while, even smaller
books about ideation, launching quickly, launching now, this blog post is about
applying those lessons, this weekend! Enough putting off, enough being part of
the 98% that says tomorrow or not now or not for me.

Book I read related to this:

- [Just Fucking Ship](https://unicornfree.com/just-fucking-ship/) (Amy Hoy)
- [Starting And Sustaining](http://startingandsustaining.com/) (Garrett Dimon)
- [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/book) (Eric Ries)
- [7 Day Startup](http://wpcurve.com/the-7-day-startup/) (Dan Norris)

Even to some extent:

- [The End of Jobs](http://taylorpearson.me/the-end-of-jobs) (Taylor Pearson)
- [The 4-Hour Workweek](http://fourhourworkweek.com/) (Timothy Ferriss)

So here I am, jamming on Daft Punk, in a café, just started the Bulletproof
Diet, just landed in Krakow, Poland, just came back from vacation, had an
idea before bed yesterday and am building it now! Don't ask me why it took
so long, the important thing is I am taking action now.

## Idea

I wanted a simple thing to build, and ideally solving some problem I had.
That's when I thought about my recent experience trying out at least 4-5
SaaS application aimed at helping freelancers manage projects, invoice their
clients and track their time. My main gripe with most of them was that they
all did really well at least one of there things but almost always had poor
support for receiving payments from clients (Xero was really good but a bit
to big for me at this point). But because they almost all adopt the do-it-all
strategy they often have less that well done features in areas that are still
important to running your business.

So, I am building an application with two business goals in mind: First, gather
payments from clients really well whichever gateway you use. Second, to
integrate with you other software that you might be using for invoicing
to sync clients and paid/unpaid status.

## Goals

**My Goal #1** is to solve my own problem of taking payments with something
else than PayPal in Freckle.

**My Goal #2** is to monetize (read market and get users) this product to a
1000$ MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) to help attenuate the consulting ups and
downs.

## Steps

### Step 1: Defining launch date

Too many times I read about people afraid of launching, worrying they don't have
enough, they need X and Y feature more. Also:

> If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late.
>
> _- Reid Hoffman_

**So,** I will launch, whatever I have at that time, on Friday the 14th of August
giving me 7 days.

### Step 2: Defining core a core feature set

The core feature set should aim to solve one use case, mine, like _DHH_ often
stated, he built Ruby on Rails for his use case but is happy to put it on the
open for people to adapt it to their needs. Focusing on this not only makes sure
one group of clients is satisfied but also make you launch way sooner, obviously.

**So,** I want the product to have:

- Support for _linking your stripe account_ using OAuth2
- Support for manually _creating a client_
- Support for manually _creating a payment_ the client owes
- Support for _sending an email_ to a client containing a payment link
- Page where the client can see his outstanding total and payments
- _Page with all clients_
- _Page with client details and all it's payments_
- _Payment processing_ sending money to client's Stripe and taking a 0.5% cut
- A _landing page_ linking to the _sign up page_
- A _signup page_
- A _login page_

### Step 3: Building
