Yes, I know it so common to see libraries, especially for documentation (huhum, _YARD_) beginning in _Yet An Other_.
But I am doing it anyway for lack of a better name.

__YAMD__ stands for _Yet An Other Markdorn Documentation Tool_, so yes it basicly let's you write small websites
in makdown and serves them as a simple rack (read sinatra) app.

There might be already a lot of these tools out there, but you know, you are never served better than by yourself!

## Using it

Write markdown in files located in the `docs/` folder and to see them apear in the left menu simply add links
to the `docs/navigation.md` file. That is all there is to it!

You can fire up a server using `bundle install && rackup`.
