Ho boy, what a week!

You know what? I did it, I launched it: [Prosty.io](https://prosty.io) is live!

Ok, it's not as grand as I wanted it to be when I started this project 7 days ago,
this is only a quickly put together landing page plus email list sign up. But, I said
I would launch what I had on Friday and that's me honoring what I said.

I have a bunch more designed and coded up but it's still missing a lot of work
to be a fully functional application.

The thing is:

**1.** I had a something pretty serious that approached "chronic fatigue syndrome"
symptoms. I wasn't able to be productive at anything all, I wanted to do was
go take a nap or eat, _always_.

Seeing how serious it was decided to put an end to it and slept for a day and a
half straight, waking up only to eat. That got me back on my feet. I begin to
think I was simply really exhausted with all this travel, weather change, stress...

**2.** I also have client work to do and have been catching up after not doing
much since I landed in Cracow 1 week ago.

I really believed this 7 day startup launch was possible if I focused on the minimum
needed and stayed in a super-productive state, but, that didn't happen.

**So**, let's adjust the schedule and, following Amy Hoy's [ship by September](https://unicornfree.com/2015/ship-by-september) challenge, Prosty.io will launch it's fully-functional MVP no later
than the 31st of August at midnight (EDT).

## Where's the progress report?

Yes, yes, it's coming, as this title suggests I will start making these progress
reports until I launch as I think it's a really good motivator not to slow down
or stop, studies proved it. Shall we start?

## What has been accomplished

- Write a thorough README for the codebase that includes a project description, technology choices, an outline of all endpoints & more
- Write an initial first part of the text for the marketing (/landing/home) page
- Design on paper the 50% of the planed for MVP pages
- Setup up the project's codebase
- Setup Heroku (hosting), this was needed for publishing that current version
- Setup DNS properly in Cloudflare
- Define the Companies, Users and ComapnyUsers tables
- Finish the sign in & sign up page design in html & css
- Finish the backend code for the sign up page
- Finish the initial marketing/landing/home page design in html & css
- Start reading up Stripe's documentation for OAuth integrations and thinking of how Prosty will use it's api.

## What is next

I am concentrating head down on making the initial client's path work so:

> Landing page -> Sign up -> Dashboard (/w on-boarding) -> Connect Stripe ->
> Dashboard (/w next on-boarding step) -> Create client -> Client page -> Create
> payment -> ...

Like this the project makes progress in a structured way that is motivating as you
know how far a potential user can already use your application. Plus, you are not
working left and right on different parts not seeing any progress.

## Parting notes

Sorry if you read my blog and didn't find this post deeply interesting, I know fully
that this article was mostly for me, don't worry, I will write other posts that will
be more educative/interesting that progress reports.
