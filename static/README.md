# The compiled version of my personal website

This blog used to be plain old html files...

Then it became a Jekyll blog for a good part of it's life...

Wishing to explore new frontiers and avoid the dependency on ruby (even if just at build time)
while keeping it static (hence using GitHub Pages) I created a tiny tool called
[muun](http://github.com/kiasaki/muun) in Go...

I now reverted to using the great [Hugo](http://gohugo.io), also written in Go.

# This is generated code...
